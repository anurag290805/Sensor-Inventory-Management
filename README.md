# Sensor-Based Inventory Management System

## Overview
An automated inventory monitoring system using sensors to track stock levels 
on supermarket shelves and trigger alerts when items need restocking.

## Objectives
- Design sensor logic to detect stock levels in real time
- Automatically trigger alerts when stock is low or depleted
- Apply embedded system design principles to a practical problem

## Tools & Technologies
- Arduino IDE
- Python
- Circuit Design
- TinkerCAD

## Key Learnings
- Practical sensor integration and hardware-software interfacing
- Real-world application of embedded systems
- Automated alert and monitoring system design
